Scenarios: 

Becky is currently a senior at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte and is interested in growing her resume so when she graduates she will be able to get a job and already have experience within her field of study. 
A couple of Becky’s friends have found jobs through resources like Hire-a-Niner and InternFourtyNiner so she decides to take a look at those websites. 
Becky’s mother wants her to get an internship and when looking at both of the websites she realises that Hire-a-Niner doesn’t have as many internship opportunities as InternFourtyNiner. 
On InternFourtyNiner all Becky has to do is input what her major is and then a whole bunch of internships are given to her. 
Each internship has a description about the company and the position so it really helps Becky narrow down her search and find an internship that works best for her. 

User Stories: 

As a student, I want to be able to find an internship that is related to my major and not have to search through a bunch of internships that I have no experience with.
