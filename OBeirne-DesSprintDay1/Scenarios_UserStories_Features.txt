Scenario

Johnny is a nineteen year old freshman looking to find an internship to get a head start on his career, preferably in the CCI concentrations. Johnny has not finished any majorly intensive classes, mostly general education, but he has a background working on small coding projects for fun. Johnny is having trouble finding open internships.

Johnny decides to use the Career Center but is unable to find any open listings that fit him and LinkedIn isn't giving him responses. In addition to this, his resume is rather lackluster and he hasn't done a formal interview before. He could either continue his education, saving an internship for after he has completed more technical courses, or he could apply and likely fail due to the previous factors. Johnny is discouraged as he really wanted to get a good headstart to save time on his later career matters and reluctantly decides  to not pursue an internship this semester.
