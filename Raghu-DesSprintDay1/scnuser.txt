Scenarios: In this scenario the possible consumer is looking for internships or any experience he can find. 
He is currently a freshman with very little to no experience. He wants to get ahead of the curve and find an
opportunity to get some experience. He finds the website on a simple google search looking for internships, 
he filters the selection of internships perhaps looking specifically for freshman/sophomore students, 
or ones that require no prior experience. After finding ones that fit both his requirements and finding 
one where he fills the role, he applies and eventually gets an offer.This puts him ahead of the competition 
and the ones not using the site are left behind.
